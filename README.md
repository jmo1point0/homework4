Beach Destinations Quiz!
I have created a beach destinations quiz.
There are multiple html, css, and js files.

Following files:
index.html
jordanhomework4.html
highscores.html
end.html
style.css
highscores.css
highscores.js
end.js

Links:

***FYI:
For some reason was not able to get to localStorage to work after quiz completes. However on my end.html page I have a text box created where I can successfully fill in a text box and save to local storage. Seems to be an issue with linking the two I could not figure out after several attempts. I was able to store several entries successfully.
Please see follow screenshots! -

***IF you review highscores.html you can also see them saving to the leaderboard there.
